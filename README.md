# Meeting Minutes - AI-Powered Meeting Assistant

An AI-powered meeting assistant that captures live meeting audio, transcribes it in real-time, and generates summaries while ensuring user privacy. Perfect for teams who want to focus on discussions while automatically capturing and organizing meeting content.

## Why?

While there are many meeting transcription tools available, this solution stands out by offering:
- **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally on your device
- **Cost Effective**: Uses open-source AI models instead of expensive APIs
- **Flexible**: Works offline, supports multiple meeting platforms
- **Customizable**: Self-host and modify for your specific needs
- **Intelligent**: Built-in knowledge graph for semantic search across meetings

## Features

✅ Modern, responsive UI with real-time updates

✅ Export to Markdown/PDF
